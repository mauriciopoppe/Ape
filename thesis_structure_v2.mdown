# Planing
Understanding why an information system should be built

1. During project initiation, the systemâ€™s business value to the organization is identified: how will it lower costs or increase revenues?

Feasibility analysis:
    - Technical feasibility
    - Economic feasibility
    - Organizational feasibility

2. Once the project is approved it enters the project management, the project manager creates a *work plan*, staffs the project, etc. The deliverable item is the *project plan*

# Analysis
The analysis phase answers the questions of who will use the system, what the sys- tem will do, and where and when it will be used.

1. Anaylsis strategy developed to guide the team's efforts
2. Requirements gathering
3. Present a document called the system proposal

# Design
The design phase decides how the system will operate in terms of the hardware, software, and network infrastructure that will be in place

1. Develop the design strategy (wether the system will be developed by the company's own programmers, outsourcing)
2. Development of the basic architecture design and the interface design
3. Database and file specifications
4. The analyst team develops the program design (define the programs that need to be written and exactly what they need to do)

# Implementation
The final phase in the SDLC is the implementation phase, during which the system is actually built (or purchased, in the case of a packaged software design and installed)

1. Systems construction (the system is built and tested to ensure that it performs as designed)
2. The system is installed
3. The analyst team establishes a support plan for the system
